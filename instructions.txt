Requires Python 3.9+

Run main.py to generate a galaxy with a few factions.
If success the script will say it.

1 Sample Galaxy is already provided,
A wormhole to access will be placed in a system close to Sag* A (the black hole)

Useable Config:
-government config
-galaxy config
-use_seed and <text>_seed for most config
-planet descriptions.txt

This is a rough proof of concept, very fragile and still buggy, beware.

#========Adding new sprites:
Currently(21/01/2022), Only new ship sprites are supported

To add new sprite set for the script to pick from, put a txt file 
in factions folder with partial definition for a ship. The script
will look for the sprite in the name and use it for the specified 
category(ies).

"ship" and "category" is required, hardpoints lines (gun,turret,engine)
only helps the script put weapon in correct places. Else it'll be random.

For multiple category the script will allow the sprite to be used 
for both categories.

[text] is optional modifier for hardpoints.  (Currently generator don't do anything with it)

Format: *Use only tabs for indents.

ship <sprite name>
	category <category1>
	category <category2>
	gun <x> <y>
		[over]
		[parallel]
		[angle] <n>
	turret <x> <y>
		[under]
	engine <x> <y>
		[zoom] <n>
		[angle] <n>
		[over]
